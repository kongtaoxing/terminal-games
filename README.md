4. [2048](./src/games/twenty_forty_eight/README.md)

## Features

- **Terminal-based Interface**: Uses `crossterm` and `tui` for smooth terminal rendering
- **Easy Navigation**: Use arrow keys or number keys to select games

4. Press **Q** to quit
5. In any game, press **p** or **Esc** to pause the game and pretend to compile some projects, and then press **Enter** to continue the game
6. Press **C** to choose the language of the code for pretending to compile
